  Welcome to MYELIN.

  Myelin is a permadeath MUD with lineages. What that means is that while your character can die permanently, some attributes
  will be carried on from character to character. Specifically, your characters gain 'memories' during their lifetime which can
  then be spent during character creation.

  Some general tips:

  - Look for Resources to use the 'gather' command on.

  - You may be attacked or try to 'kill' an enemy. 

  - 'Flee'ing is a valid tactic.

  - Don't forget to use your 'skills'.

  - Find or 'craft' a key to the portal.

  - Playing with friends is fun, you can 'follow' each other.
  
  - Once you level up, be sure to 'learn' and 'train'.
